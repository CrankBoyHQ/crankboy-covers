# Playdate Asset Compiler
#
# This script converts a folder of PNG images into a clean directory
# containing only the compiled Playdate image assets (.pdi files).
#
# It performs the following steps:
#   1. Creates a temporary build directory for dithered PNGs.
#   2. Analyzes image contrast and dynamically dithers source PNGs into the build directory.
#   3. Compiles the build directory into a .pdx package.
#   4. Extracts ONLY the compiled .pdi files from inside the .pdx package.
#   5. Moves the .pdi files to a final, clean assets directory.
#   6. Deletes all temporary build files and the .pdx package.
#
# USAGE:
#   Place this script in a folder with your source PNG images and execute it.
#   Requires: ImageMagick, the Playdate SDK (for pdc), and bc.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Configuration ---
# The final, clean directory that will contain ONLY the compiled .pdi files.
FINAL_ASSETS_DIR="__final_pdi_assets"

# The name of the temporary directory for intermediate work.
BUILD_DIR="__build_temp"

# The maximum dimensions for the output images.
# Images will be scaled down to fit within this box, preserving aspect ratio.
MAX_DIMENSIONS="240x240"

# --- Dynamic Contrast Configuration ---
# The script will calculate contrast and apply a stretch between MAX and MIN.
# Standard deviation is used as the measure of contrast.
MAX_CONTRAST_STRETCH=5.0
MIN_CONTRAST_STRETCH=0.0
# Any image with std dev below this gets the MAX stretch.
LOW_CONTRAST_THRESHOLD=0.1
# Any image with std dev above this gets the MIN stretch.
HIGH_CONTRAST_THRESHOLD=0.3


# --- Safety Checks ---
# Exit immediately if a command fails or if trying to use an unset variable.
set -eu

# Check if required commands are installed.

# Playdate Asset Compiler
#
# This script converts a folder of PNG images into a clean directory
# containing only the compiled Playdate image assets (.pdi files).
#
# It performs the following steps:
#   1. Creates a temporary build directory for dithered PNGs.
#   2. Converts source PNGs to dithered, 1-bit PNGs in the build directory.
#   3. Compiles the build directory into a .pdx package.
#   4. Extracts ONLY the compiled .pdi files from inside the .pdx package.
#   5. Moves the .pdi files to a final, clean assets directory.
#   6. Deletes all temporary build files and the .pdx package.
#
# USAGE:
#   Place this script in a folder with your source PNG images and execute it.
#   Requires: OptiPNG, ImageMagick, and the Playdate SDK (for pdc).

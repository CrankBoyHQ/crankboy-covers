# Playdate Asset Compiler
#
# This script converts a folder of PNG images into a clean directory
# containing only the compiled Playdate image assets (.pdi files).
#
# It performs the following steps:
#   1. Creates a temporary build directory for dithered PNGs.
#   2. Resizes, converts, and dithers source PNGs into the build directory.
#   3. Compiles the build directory into a .pdx package.
#   4. Extracts ONLY the compiled .pdi files from inside the .pdx package.
#   5. Moves the .pdi files to a final, clean assets directory.
#   6. Deletes all temporary build files and the .pdx package.
#
# USAGE:
#   Place this script in a folder with your source PNG images and execute it.
#   Requires: ImageMagick, and the Playdate SDK (for pdc).
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Configuration ---
# The final, clean directory that will contain ONLY the compiled .pdi files.
FINAL_ASSETS_DIR="__final_pdi_assets"

# The name of the temporary directory for intermediate work.
BUILD_DIR="__build_temp"

# The percentage of pixels to saturate to black and white.
# This increases contrast and prevents "muddy" dithering.
# "0%" disables it. "1%" to "5%" is a good range to try.
CONTRAST_AMOUNT="2%"

# The maximum dimensions for the output images.
# Images will be scaled down to fit within this box, preserving aspect ratio.
MAX_DIMENSIONS="240x240"
